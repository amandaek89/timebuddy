/**
 * This package contains controller classes responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
 * Controllers interact with the service layer to process requests, return appropriate responses,
 * and ensure proper user interactions with the application.
 *
 * REST controllers are annotated with @RestController, and they expose various endpoints
 * for client interaction. The controllers handle the routing, parsing of requests, and returning
 * of responses in a RESTful manner.
